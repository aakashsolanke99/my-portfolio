          - I have learned a lot about technology stack and along with that I
          have worked on Java full-stack project. A web-based application is
          used as an interface forthe patients to book their appointment based
          on the available physician. The booked appointments can be accepted or
          rejected by the physician and the approved appointments will be listed
          for the nurse to enter basic diagnosis and health information.Once the
          nurse completed entering the basic diagnosis information of the
          patient for the visit, it will be queued to the doctor to further
          enter the medication details during his consultation with the patient.
          Patients can access their health records at any time
