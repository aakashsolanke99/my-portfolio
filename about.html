        <h4>Java Full Stack Developer</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="name-1">
        Young and enthusiastic full-stack Java developer with experience in
        building Web-Based Applications who graduated with a Bachelor’s degree
        in Instrumentation from the Government College of Engineering, Jalgaon.
        Over the past months, I have worked on several projects where I gained
        experience in back-end technologies such as Java, Advance Java, MySQL,
        Servlet, JSP,  Spring framework, Spring boot, Spring cloud and
        micro-services architecture, and front-end development such as HTML/CSS,
        JavaScript, and Angular. I also have experience with DevOps and CI/CD
        pipelines, deploying to AWS and Docker.  <br />Revature’s training has
        also imposed more excellent knowledge of Agile practices, Software
        Development life cycle (SDLC), and Version Control Systems like
        Git/GitHub Tools and helped me get familiar with and gain in-depth
        knowledge of the working environment. I am very excited about learning
        more software tools and getting to work with awesome teams. I am good at
        sports and love to play cricket. Since childhood, I have been fond of
        drawing.
